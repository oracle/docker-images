<!--
This XML document is a default Coherence Cache Configuration deployment descriptor that should be
customized (or replaced) for your particular caching and deployment requirements.

This configuration is usable in servers, proxies, clustered clients, and non-clustered extend clients.

When used from within a server such a DefaultCacheServer, the server will automatically host a storage enabled cache
service as well as a proxy service to allow extend clients to access the caches.  Clients using the configuration are
storage disabled by default.

This configuration defines a number of inter-related cache schemes:

 - server      - this scheme defines the storage tier for all caches
 - thin-direct - this scheme is for use by cluster members to access the caches hosted by the "server" scheme
 - near-direct - this scheme adds near caching to "thin-direct"
 - thin-remote - conceptually similar to "thin-direct" but for use by extend clients
 - near-remote - conceptually similar to "near-direct" but for use by extend clients

The default scheme for caches is "near-direct".  This default can be overridden via two system properties.  The
"coherence.profile" system property controls the first portion of the scheme name and defines the approach used for
in-process caching, i.e. "near" (on-demand) or "thin" (none).  The "coherence.client" system property controls how a
client connects to the cluster, i.e. "direct" (cluster member) or "remote" (extend client).

Note: System properties defined within this cache configuration are specific to this configuration and are not
meaningful to other cache configurations unless similarly defined there.
