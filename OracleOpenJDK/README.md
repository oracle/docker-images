# Oracle Java OpenJDK in Containers

This repository contains sample container configurations to facilitate installation and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes `Dockerfiles` for Oracle OpenJDK based on Oracle Linux.

## Building the Oracle Java OpenJDK base image

Navigate to the folder containing the `Dockerfile` and run `docker build`, tagging the image with the version number:

e.g. for OpenJDK 23 run

```bash
cd ../OracleOpenJDK/23
docker build --file Dockerfile.ol9 --tag oracle/openjdk:23 .
```

This command is already scripted in `build.sh` so you can alternatively run:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

### Parent image OS version

The Oracle Java images for OpenJDK 23 uses `oraclelinux:9` as the default parent image.
