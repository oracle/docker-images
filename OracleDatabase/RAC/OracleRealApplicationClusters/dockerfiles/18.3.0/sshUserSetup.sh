#Usage sshUserSetup.sh  -user <user name> [ -hosts \"<space separated hostlist>\" | -hostfile <absolute path of cluster configuration file> ] [ -advanced ]  [ -verify] [ -exverify ] [ -logfile <desired absolute path of logfile> ] [-confirm] [-shared] [-help] [-usePassphrase] [-noPromptPassphrase]
#eg. sshUserSetup.sh -hosts "host1 host2" -user njerath -advanced
#This script is used to setup SSH connectivity from the host on which it is
# run to the specified remote hosts. After this script is run, the user can use # SSH to run commands on the remote hosts or copy files between the local host
# and the remote hosts without being prompted for passwords or confirmations.
# The list of remote hosts and the user name on the remote host is specified as 
# a command line parameter to the script. Note that in case the user on the 
# remote host has its home directory NFS mounted or shared across the remote 
# hosts, this script should be used with -shared option. 
#Specifying the -advanced option on the command line would result in SSH 
# connectivity being setup among the remote hosts which means that SSH can be 
# used to run commands on one remote host from the other remote host or copy 
# files between the remote hosts without being prompted for passwords or 
# confirmations.
#Please note that the script would remove write permissions on the remote hosts
#for the user home directory and ~/.ssh directory for "group" and "others". This
# is an SSH requirement. The user would be explicitly informed about this by the script and prompted to continue. In case the user presses no, the script would exit. In case the user does not want to be prompted, they can use the -confirm option.
# As a part of the setup, the script would use SSH to create files within ~/.ssh
# directory of the remote node and to setup the requisite permissions. The 
#script also uses SCP to copy the local host public key to the remote hosts so
# that the remote hosts trust the local host for SSH. At the time, the script 
#performs these steps, SSH connectivity has not been completely setup  hence
# the script would prompt the user for the remote host password. 
#For each remote host, for remote users with non-shared homes this would be 
# done once for SSH and  once for SCP. If the number of remote hosts are x, the 
# user would be prompted  2x times for passwords. For remote users with shared 
# homes, the user would be prompted only twice, once each for SCP and SSH.
#For security reasons, the script does not save passwords and reuse it. Also, 
# for security reasons, the script does not accept passwords redirected from a 
#file. The user has to key in the confirmations and passwords at the prompts.
#The -verify option means that the user just wants to verify whether SSH has 
#been set up. In this case, the script would not setup SSH but would only check
# whether SSH connectivity has been setup from the local host to the remote 
# hosts. The script would run the date command on each remote host using SSH. In
# case the user is prompted for a password or sees a warning message for a 
#particular host, it means SSH connectivity has not been setup correctly for
# that host.
#In case the -verify option is not specified, the script would setup SSH and 
#then do the verification as well.
#In case the user speciies the -exverify option, an exhaustive verification would be done. In that case, the following would be checked:
# 1. SSH connectivity from local host to all remote hosts.
# 2. SSH connectivity from each remote host to itself and other remote hosts.
