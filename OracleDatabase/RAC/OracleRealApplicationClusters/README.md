# Oracle RAC Database on Container

Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) is an option to the award-winning Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. Oracle RAC is a cluster database with a shared cache architecture that overcomes the limitations of traditional shared-nothing and shared-disk approaches to provide highly scalable and available database solutions for all business applications. Oracle RAC uses Oracle Clusterware as a portable cluster software that allows clustering of independent servers so that they cooperate as a single system and Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) to provide simplified storage management that is consistent across all servers and storage platforms. Oracle Clusterware and Oracle ASM are part of the Oracle Grid Infrastructure, which bundles both solutions in an easy to deploy software package.

For more information on Oracle RAC Database 21c refer to the [Oracle Database documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/en/database/).
