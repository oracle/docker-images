# Container image template for Oracle Instant Client 21
#
# This file is found at:
# https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/main/OracleInstantClient/oraclelinux8/21/Dockerfile
#
# HOW TO BUILD THIS IMAGE AND RUN A CONTAINER
# --------------------------------------------
#
# Execute:
#      $ podman build --pull -t oraclelinux8-instantclient:21 .
#      $ podman run -ti --rm oraclelinux8-instantclient:21 sqlplus /nolog
#
# NOTES
# -----
#
# Applications using Oracle Call Interface (OCI) 21 can connect to
# Oracle Database 12.1 or later.  Some tools may have other
# restrictions.
#
# Oracle Instant Client 21 automatically configures the global library search
# path to include Instant Client libraries.
#
# OPTIONAL ORACLE CONFIGURATION FILES
# -----------------------------------
#
# Optional Oracle Network and Oracle client configuration files can be put in the
# default configuration file directory /usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/lib/network/admin.
# Configuration files include tnsnames.ora, sqlnet.ora, oraaccess.xml and
# cwallet.sso.  You can use a Docker volume to mount the directory containing
# the files at runtime, for example:
#
#   podman run -v /my/host/wallet_dir:/usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/lib/network/admin:Z,ro . . .
#
# This avoids embedding private information such as wallets in images.  If you
# do choose to include network configuration files in images, you can use a
# Dockerfile COPY, for example:
#
#   COPY tnsnames.ora sqlnet.ora /usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/lib/network/admin/
#
# There is no need to set the TNS_ADMIN environment variable when files are in
# the container's default configuration file directory, as shown.
#
